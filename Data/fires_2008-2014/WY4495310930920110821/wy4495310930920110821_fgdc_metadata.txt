Description:
  Abstract:
    Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) is a multi-year project designed to consistently map the burn severity and perimeters of fires across all lands of the United States from 1984 and beyond. The data generated by MTBS will be used to identify national trends in burn severity, providing information necessary to monitor the effectiveness and effects of the National Fire Plan and Healthy Forests Restoration Act. MTBS is sponsored by the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC), a multi-agency oversight group responsible for implementing and coordination the National Fire Plan and Federal Wildland Fire Management Policies. The project is conducted through a partnership between the U.S. Geological Survey National Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) and the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC).
    The objective of the MTBS program is to provide consistent, 30 meter resolution burn severity data and fire perimeters. The data is intended to serve four primary user groups:
      1. National policies and policy makers such as the National Fire Plan and WFLC which require information about long-term trends in burn severity and recent burn severity impacts within vegetation types, fuel models, condition classes, and land management activities.
      2. Field management units that benefit from mid to broad scale GIS-ready maps and data for pre- and post-fire assessment and monitoring. Field units that require finer scale burn severity data will also benefit from increased efficiency, reduced costs, and data consistency by starting with MTBS data.
      3. Existing databases from other comparably scaled programs, such as Fire Regime and Condition Class (FRCC) within LANDFIRE, that will benefit from MTBS data for validation and updating of geospatial data sets.
      4. Academic and agency research entities interested in fire severity data over significant geographic and temporal extents.
    MTBS is similar to other image processing and analysis methods currently utilized by the USGS and USFS for post-fire burn severity mapping efforts. The USGS Landsat image archive provides a consistent and continuous source of 30 meter resolution data for mapping burn severity of all fires greater than 1000 acres in the west and 500 acres in the east.

Supplemental_Information:
  The MTBS Fire-ID is generated by combining several attributes taken from the fire ignition location and start date. The MTBS Fire-ID is constructed from the two letter state abbreviation, the decimal degree latitude and longitude, both carried to the third decimal place without the decimal point (if less than 100 degrees the longitude is padded with a leading '0'), and the start date formatted as YYYYMMDD (e.g., TX2672909780020110102).

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy: Attribute_Accuracy_Report: MTBS geospatial data (both vector and raster) are generated using consistent methods and procedures. The differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image datasets are examined on a fire by fire basis to develop a thresholded, or categorical, burn severity dataset.

Quantitative_Attribute_Accuracy_Assessment:
  Attribute_Accuracy_Explanation: MTBS analysts examine the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image for each fire in the context of remote sensing spectral data and any ancillary information available to the analyst. dNBR image data for each fire are thresholded into classes representing unburned areas; areas of low, moderate, high burn severities; and areas of increased vegetation response. Analysts follow guidelines established by subject matter experts in order to maintain consistency in discerning burn severity thresholds from fire to fire and minimize subjectivity.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: These Landsat data are collected from a nominal altitude of 705 kilometers in a near-polar, near-circular, sun-synchronous orbit at an inclination of 98.2 degrees, imaging the same 183-km swath of Earth's surface every 16 days. The pixels representing the bands for the image are in the data set only once.
  Completeness_Report: Fire Perimeter Generation Method: Manual (from metadata)

Positional_Accuracy:
  Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
  Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Each Landsat Thematic Mapper image used to create the burn severity assessment was precision terrain-corrected using 3-arc-second digital terrain elevation data (DTED), and georegistered using ground control points. This resulted in a root mean square registration error of less than 1 pixel (30 meters).Lineage:

Process_Step:
  Process_Description: These data products are derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper data. A pre-fire scene and a post-fire scene are analyzed to create a Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image. The dNBR image portrays the variations of burn severity within the fire. The Landsat images are terrain corrected and geometrically rectified to an Albers Conical Equal Area map projection using the National Landsat Archive Production System (NLAPS). The images are further processed to convert bands 1-5 and 7 to at-satellite-reflectance. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is computed for each date of imagery using the following formula:

    ((Band 4 - Band 7) / (Band 4 + Band 7)) x 1000 = NBR

  The differenced NBR is computed by subtracting the post-fire NBR from the pre-fire NBR:

    PreNBR - PostNBR = dNBR

  Further processing is required to generate the 'Relativized' dNBR (RdNBR). The RdNBR takes into account pre fire conditions related to the amount of vegetation cover vs. bare soil. In one sense, an area of 25% vegetation cover that burns completely should be considered 'high severity' as would an area of 100% cover that burned completely. The dNBR does not allow that distinction. To calculate the RdNBR, the analyst must determine the 'dNBR offset value': the average dNBR value of a nearby area of unburned vegetation (similar to the vegetation that did burn). The RdNBR is calculated as follows:

    (dNBR - dNBROffset)/ (Square Root of Absolute Value(PreNBR/1000)) = RdNBR

  Higher dNBR and RdNBR values are correlated with more severe burns. The dNBR image is evaluated to determine the threshold value between burned and unburned areas. The perimeter of the fire is delineated using the dNBR and/or post-fire reflectance image. The dNBR image, the pre-fire and post-fire TM images, and a fire perimeter vector file are provided in digital format.
